The dataset that we are using is the Pittsburgh Fast-Food Image Dataset (PFID)

Pittsburgh Fast Food Image Dataset is a data set containing 4,545 images of fast food, 606 stereo pairs, 303
360 degree videos.

We are currently limiting our scope to just pizzas. In this dataset, they only have pizzas from Pizza Hut, however
they also contain a lot of different varieties ranging from Regular Cheese to Dessert Cherry Nut Pizza.

The dataset also contains the approximate calorie count for each type of food. These approximate calories can also be obtained from the Fast Food companies website.
